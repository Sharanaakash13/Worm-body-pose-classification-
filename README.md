# Worm-body-pose-classification-

- The goal of this project is to classify the worms based on the body shape.
- In this project Convolutional Neural Network is trained and validated using 15K images. 

### Following steps are carried out, 
- Labelling the worm manually making it Supervised learning.
- Pre-processing the image
- Training CNN Arhictectures 
  - Convolutional Neural network framework (Experiment with no. of layers)
  - Convolutional Neural network framework (Lenet)
- Hyperparameter tuning (Bayesian Optimization)
- Accuracy comparision
